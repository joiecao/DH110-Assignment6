# Assignment06: Interface Design
### DH110, Joie Cao

## Intro
For my project, I intend to redesign and rebrand PCPartPicker's site, making it more modern, user friendly, and accessible for first time PC builders. Rather than redesign the website, I have redesigned its core features into an app. This app allows users to plan their builds, learn by watching tutorials and studying premade builds, and share their own builds on a social platform. My app intends to further promote the social aspect.

My 4 high fidelity interfaces include the following:
1. A loading screen for when the app is launched 
2. A log in/sign up screen, also a first impression for most users 
3. A PC building screen where users can add parts to their build
4. A social media-like build sharing screen that also includes premade build guides
